# VA-Mental-Health-Visualization
This project is to understand how mental health varies across demographics in the armed forces.


Understand whats in the data/how to read the data

- Sociodemographic data
- Diagnoses_Mental Illness 

The objective of the project is twofold: (1) to understand the breakdown of mental illness in the armed forces by gender, race, geography, other health conditions, etc. and (2) to see if there are any correlations between other health conditions and the respective mental illness.

Decide how to join data

Once I understand how the data breaks down by mental illness categories, I would like to understand how counts by health conditions further break down by gender, age and race. I would have to join the sex and age tables with a common Long_title + Short_title + Group + Group1 + Subgroup to get respective breakdowns. It would be interesting to see how correlations between mental illness and health conditions differ by these features.
